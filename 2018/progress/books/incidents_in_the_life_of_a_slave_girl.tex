"That poor ignorant woman thought that America was governed by a Queen, to whom the President was subordinate. I wish the President was subordinate to Queen Justice."

\begin{quotebox}
"Yet few slaveholders seem to be aware of the widespread moral ruin occasioned by this wicked system. Their talk is of blighted cotton crops -- not the blight on their children's souls."

I could ramble on, give a book report, if you will -- but I won't. I'll let those two quotes, written over 160 years ago, carry that for me.

I selected this as my first book to read in 2018 because 2017 troubled me. I wanted to look back as a means of looking forward. I read it in one sitting and am preparing to head to bed, reflecting on white supremacists and tiki torches and a President who cares more about monuments to slaveholders than he does about living breathing human beings -- and I wonder how many generations must pass before they rise above the "moral ruin".

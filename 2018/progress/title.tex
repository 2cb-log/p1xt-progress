\section{Abstract}

I'm tackling my 2018 learning goals in true "Speedrun" style. The following list contains far more than I expect I'll be able to complete in 2018, so it's sufficient that I can speedrun the year without running out of items from the list to learn.

My dual main goals are to A) study algorithms in depth and B) explore Physics. To that end, I am including a variety of Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics courses, with no prescribed order. I'll just select the next course in whatever list I'm most inspired to continue each time I'm ready to progress to a new course.

Additionally, I'm including a variety of "bonus point" opportunities for reading books, completing projects, and completing algorithmic challenges.

My goal is to see how many points I can rack up by December 31, 2018.

\textbf{Current Course:} 18.01\\
\textbf{Total Points:} 0

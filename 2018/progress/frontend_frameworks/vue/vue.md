# Vue - Tiered Deep Dive

 The following study outline is a modified deep dive, skipping some of the familiarization and pre-requisite resources already covered but still aiming for a rock solid foundation in everything Vue.  It is a different path than learning "just enough," instead combining thorough study of the official docs, regular practice projects, comprehensive exploration of Vue's ecosystem and hands on non-Vue JavaScript practice.

#### Study each item thoroughly. Type the code. Understand how it works. Yes, the whole thing.   

##### For each project:
 * Use a git workflow

##### For at least one project:
 * Code all CSS yourself
 * Use Bootstrap
